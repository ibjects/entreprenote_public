                        entrepreneurs
                        and innovators brainstorm, organize, and refine startup ideas using note-taking tools and
                        AI-powered assistance. The Service enables you to create and manage unlimited idea entries,
                        attach and organize notes, and respond to structured prompts (over 200 guided questions) to
                        develop different aspects of your business ideas. Throughout the process, Entreprenote provides
                        intelligent suggestions and content to inspire and guide your planning.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left mt-4">In addition, Entreprenote includes
                        community and
                        networking features, such as a mini-marketplace where third-party service providers (for
                        example, product development agencies or marketing experts) offer deals and resources, and a
                        public event discovery section where you can find startup-related events and workshops. These
                        features help connect you with external resources and opportunities relevant to your
                        entrepreneurial journey.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left mt-4">The Service is accessible via a mobile
                        application
                        and a web application. Core features are available to all users for free, while advanced
                        capabilities are offered through an optional premium subscription (see Section 5 for details on
                        Premium Membership). Some features of the Service may still be in development or offered as beta
                        releases. We strive to improve the platform continuously, and certain features (such as AI
                        assistants or new tools) may be introduced, modified, or removed as the Service evolves (see
                        Section 11 on Changes to the Service).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left">Entreprenote integrates advanced artificial
                        intelligence
                        technologies (such as large language models provided by third parties like OpenAI or Google) to
                        power features including Chameleon Charlie and the Idea Agent. While these AI-driven features
                        are designed to provide helpful insights, guidance, and content, it is important to understand
                        their limitations. <strong>You should not rely solely on AI-generated outputs for making
                            important decisions or plans.</strong> The information and suggestions provided by Chameleon
                        Charlie, the Idea Agent, or any other AI features within the Service are for informational and
                        brainstorming purposes only. They may not always be accurate, complete, or tailored to your
                        specific circumstances.</p>

                        accuracy,
                        reliability, or quality of the content generated by its AI features. The AI might occasionally
                        produce content that is incorrect, irrelevant, or inappropriate. For example, the AI might
                        misunderstand your question, provide outdated information, or generate text that does not make
                        sense in context. If you encounter an AI-generated response that seems questionable or
                        offensive, we encourage you to ignore that output and report it to us so we can improve our
                        systems. You should always use your own judgment and, if necessary, seek professional advice
                        (for example, legal or financial advice) rather than relying exclusively on AI outputs from the
                        Service.</p>

                        understand
                        and agree that your inputs (such as the questions you ask Chameleon Charlie or the data from
                        your idea that you allow the Idea Agent to analyze) may be sent to and processed by third-party
                        AI providers that we work with. We take precautions to transmit your data securely to these
                        providers and only share what is necessary to generate a helpful response. These third-party AI
                        services operate under their own terms and privacy policies, and we contractually require them
                        to handle your data in compliance with applicable laws and only for the purposes of providing
                        the AI functionality. However, we cannot guarantee how a third-party service might treat your
                        information beyond these commitments. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information on
                        data handling related to AI features. <em>By using the AI features, you also agree to abide by
                            any usage policies of the third-party AI providers, as applicable.</em></p>

                        features in
                        compliance with our Acceptable Use policy. This means, for example, you will not attempt to use
                        the AI to generate disallowed content (such as hate speech or other prohibited material), and
                        you will not attempt to misuse the AI by exploiting vulnerabilities or attempting to obtain
                        other users' information. We may impose certain usage limits on AI features (such as a cap on
                        the number of queries or a rate limit) for technical reasons or to ensure fair use between
                        users. These limits may differ for free users versus Premium subscribers. We also reserve the
                        right to filter or modify queries or outputs from the AI features in order to enforce these
                        Terms or to adhere to the policies of our AI providers, but we are not liable for any content
                        that the AI produces. You use the AI features at your own risk, and you understand that any
                        advice or information provided by our AI is provided "as is" without warranty (as further

                        links to
                        third-party services and content. This includes, for example, the mini-marketplace where
                        external service providers offer their products or services to our users, the public event
                        discovery section listing events hosted by third parties, and various partner integrations (such
                        as analytics tools, authentication/login providers, or payment processors). While we curate and
                        provide access to some of this third-party content to enhance your experience, these third-party
                        offerings are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their content, actions, or

                        engagements you have
                        with third parties found via Entreprenote are solely between you and those third parties. For
                        instance, if you decide to hire a service provider discovered through our mini-marketplace (such
                        as a developer for your MVP or a marketing consultant), any contract or agreement you enter into
                        is directly between you and that provider. Entreprenote is not a party to those dealings, and we
                        do not guarantee or endorse the services that third parties offer. Similarly, if you RSVP to or
                        attend an event that you found through our event discovery feature, we are not responsible for
                        the event itself; any arrangements, fees, or obligations are strictly between you and the event
                        organizers.</p>

                        some degree (for example, by partnering with certain providers or filtering event submissions),
                        we cannot guarantee that every third-party offering will meet your expectations or be suitable
                        for your needs. You should exercise your own judgment and due diligence when deciding to engage

                        through the marketplace or commenting on an event you attended), you must ensure that your
                        postings are honest, respectful, and comply with these Terms (especially the Acceptable Use
                        policy in Section 8). Prohibited content, such as false statements, defamatory remarks, spam, or
                        harassment, is not allowed in reviews or comments. Entreprenote reserves the right to moderate,
                        edit, or remove any user-generated reviews or comments that violate our standards or policies.
                        We may also suspend or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly post inappropriate or
                        abusive content.</p>

                        third-party

                        the product), Crashlytics or Sentry for crash reporting and diagnostics, and potentially other

                        when using these tools. However, Entreprenote shall not be held liable for any issues or
                        breaches that arise from the actions of such third-party providers, beyond our reasonable
