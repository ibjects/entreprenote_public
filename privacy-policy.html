                        Artificial
                        Intelligence
                        to help you develop ideas and get answers or suggestions. When you choose to use these AI-driven
                        features, your input text (e.g. the content of your note or question) is sent to our AI
                        processing
                        service in order to generate a response. We transmit this data securely over encrypted channels
                        to the
                        AI engine. Importantly, we do <strong>not</strong> include your personal identifiers (such as
                        your name
                        or email) with the data sent to the AI – only the necessary text of your query or note is
                        processed. AI
                        interactions are used solely to provide you with assistance and improve your in-app experience;

                        not use them to profile you or for marketing purposes.</p>

                        third-party
                        provider (for example, an AI cloud service). According to our provider's policies, they do not
                        use data
                        submitted through the API to train their general models unless you opt in, and they retain such
                        input
                        data only for a short period (e.g. 30 days) to monitor for abuse. This means any content you
                        submit for
                        AI processing is not used to improve the AI's own capabilities by default, and is only stored
                        temporarily for safety reasons. Both we and our AI provider are committed to protecting the
                        confidentiality of your data. We do not retain the AI request content or responses in your
                        account

                        Analytics &

                    <p class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left">We use a few analytics and error-reporting
                        tools to
                        understand
                        how our app is used and to ensure it runs smoothly. We do this to improve Entreprenote's
                        functionality
                        and fix issues quickly. The tools we use and what they collect are:</p>
                    <ul class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left">
                        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage
                            statistics
                            about our app. This helps us see things like how many users we have, which features are most
                            popular, and overall usage patterns. We have configured Google Analytics not to collect any
                            personally identifiable information about you. For example, we might track that a certain
                            button was
                            clicked 1000 times in a week, but we do not send your name, email, or note content to Google
                            Analytics. Google Analytics may automatically collect device information (such as device
                            model, OS
                            version, region, and a randomized device identifier) and event information (like screens
                            viewed or
                            time spent in the app). This data is used in aggregate form to help us improve user
                            experience. You
                            can opt out of Google Analytics data collection by enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" or
                            similar
                            settings on your device, which our Analytics will honor if applicable.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Sentry (Crash Reporting):</strong> We use Sentry for debugging and crash reporting.
                            Sentry
                            automatically captures error logs and crash diagnostics when the app encounters a problem,
                            so that
                            we can see what went wrong and fix bugs. The information collected by Sentry may include
                            device
                            type, operating system version, app version, and technical details about the error (for
                            example, the
                            function that crashed or a snippet of code error). We do not intentionally send any personal
                            data
                            like your name, email, or note content in these crash reports. The data Sentry collects is
                            used
                            solely to analyze and improve app stability. Sentry uses randomly generated identifiers for
                            sessions
                            and does not track you across apps or use your crash data for any purpose other than
                            providing crash
                            analytics. Crash reports show us things like the number of affected users and devices for a
                            given
                            issue, but they appear as anonymized statistics. This helps us prioritize and fix issues
                            without
                            identifying individual users.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Internal Development Tools:</strong> In our development process, we utilize various
                            internal
                            tools such as QA testing software, automated unit tests, and Storybook (a UI development
                            tool).
                            These tools run in our development environment (not in the live app) and use simulated data.
                            They do
                            not collect or process real user data from your use of the app. They are mentioned here for
                            transparency but have no access to your personal information.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left italic mt-4">Aside from the tools listed above,
                        Entreprenote does
                        not use any third-party advertising trackers or ad SDKs. We also currently do not use cookies or
                        similar
                        tracking technologies within the mobile app (any analytics are embedded in the app code as
                        described,
                        not via web cookies). In the future, if we introduce new analytics or tracking tools, we will
                        update
                        this Privacy Policy and ensure they are disclosed to you.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left italic mt-2">(For information on our use of data
                        for
                        debugging and
                        performance monitoring, you can refer to similar practices by other apps: for example, apps that
                        use
                        Google Analytics and Sentry typically only send anonymized usage trends and error information.)

                        or premium feature unlocks) are handled through the Apple App Store (for iOS) or Google Play
                        Store (for
                        Android). We do not process or collect your direct payment information (like credit card
                        numbers, bank
                        info, or billing address) ourselves. When you make a purchase, it is processed securely by Apple
                        or
                        Google via your App Store account. Those platforms may provide us with a confirmation or receipt

                        minimal data
                        needed to recognize and honor your purchase within Entreprenote. This includes, for example, a

                        ID or transaction identifier, the product or subscription you purchased, and its status (active,
                        expired, canceled, etc.). We might also record the date of purchase and the duration (e.g. a
                        one-month
                        or one-year subscription period) so that the app knows until when your premium access is valid.
                        No
                        sensitive payment details (card info, PayPal accounts, etc.) are ever seen or stored by

                        the
                        subscription is good for N months." We keep that information to manage your premium features. If
                        you
                        later cancel or the subscription expires, Apple/Google notifies us via a receipt update, and we

                            removed from our active database immediately or within a short time. However, the data may
                            persist
                            in our secured backups for a period until those backups are cycled out. During this interim
                            period,
                            your data is isolated and protected – it is not accessible to the operational service or any
                            personnel except if required for system restoration. We ensure that such retained backup
                            data is not
                            used for any other purpose and is destroyed within the retention window. In line with
                            industry
                            practices, if complete immediate deletion from backups is not feasible, we securely store
                            and
                            isolate the data until deletion is possible. All personal data will be fully purged from all
                            backups
                            and logs within the 6-month window after account deletion.</li>
                        <br />

                        <li><strong>Legal Requirements and Preventing Abuse:</strong> In certain cases, we might need to
                            retain
                            specific information for longer than the general retention period, if necessary to comply
                            with legal
                            obligations or to resolve disputes. For example, we may keep invoice records or purchase
                            receipts
                            for accounting/tax purposes, or retain data if we believe it's necessary to investigate
                            misuse of
                            our service (such as fraud or security incidents). If we need to retain data for such
                            reasons, we
                            will only do so to the extent and duration required (e.g. keeping a transaction record for
                            the
                            number of years required by tax law), and we will ensure it's securely stored. After that
                            period, it
                            will be deleted or anonymized.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left mt-4">We also reserve the right to retain and
                        use
                        aggregated or
                        anonymized data indefinitely for analytical insights, statistics, or trend analysis. In summary,
                        we do
                        not keep your personal information forever by default. When it's no longer needed to serve you
                        or
                        fulfill legal obligations, we remove it from our systems.</p>

                        <li><strong>Submitting a Deletion Request:</strong> You can request deletion through the app's
                            account
                            settings (if available) or by contacting our support (see Contact Us below). For security,
                            we may
                            ask you to confirm your request (especially if done via email or support ticket) to ensure
                            it's
                            truly you making the request.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Immediate Account Closure:</strong> Once we receive a confirmed deletion request, we
                            will
                            deactivate (close) your account immediately. This means you will lose access to your account
                            – you
                            won't be able to log in, and any content or notes you had will no longer be accessible
                            through the
                            app. The account enters a "deletion pending" state on our side.</li>
                        <br />

                        <li><strong>Data Eradication Timeline:</strong> We then proceed to delete all personal data
                            associated
                            with your account from our active databases. Your profile information, notes/ideas, and any
                            other
                            identifiable data will be removed from our production servers. Furthermore, we will ensure
                            that all
                            your data is fully wiped from all our systems (including backups) within 6 months of the
                            deletion
                            request. In many cases, this will be done much sooner. The 6-month period is a maximum to
                            account
                            for any delayed deletion from encrypted backups or logs.</li>
                        <br />

                        <li><strong>Permanent Deletion:</strong> Account deletion is permanent and irreversible. Once
                            your data
                            is deleted as described, there is no way to recover it. This includes all your notes,
                            content, and
                            account info.</li>
                        <br />

                        <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We will also communicate deletion to any third-party
                            services
                            integral to providing the service. Where possible, we will remove or anonymize your entries.

                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Legal or Exceptional Retention:</strong> In rare cases, we may retain data for legal
                            compliance or dispute resolution for the minimum required time, then delete it.</li>
